List and describe three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.
Rubric for Cell Membrane
Key Elements:
• Selective permeability is used by the cell membrane to allow certain substances to move across.
• Passive transport occurs when substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.
• Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane.
• Facilitated diffusion occurs when the membrane controls the pathway for a particle to enter or leave a cell.
• Active transport occurs when a cell uses energy to move a substance across the cell membrane, and/or a substance moves from an area of low to high concentration, or against the concentration gradient.
• Pumps are used to move charged particles like sodium and potassium ions through membranes using energy and carrier proteins.
• Membrane-assisted transport occurs when the membrane of the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane forcing large molecules out of the cell as in exocytosis.
• Membrane-assisted transport occurs when molecules are engulfed by the cell membrane as in endocytosis.
• Membrane-assisted transport occurs when vesicles are formed around large molecules as in phagocytosis.
• Membrane-assisted transport occurs when vesicles are formed around liquid droplets as in pinocytosis.
• Protein channels or channel proteins allow for the movement of specific molecules or substances into or out of the cell.
